        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        What I'm hoping my finished personal portfolio page will contain: 
        Valuable experience - 
        - Mission: I served 2 years in argentina as a Full-Time Missionary for the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day-saints. Aside from religious proselytizing I worked in a number of voluntary humanitarian volunteer work roles including construction, agriculture and poverty outreach. 
        - Eagle Scout: Throughout my youth I worked toward and eventually achieved the rank of Eagle-scout, necesitating an understanding and proficiency in skills like first aid, leadership/organization and most importantly; tying knots. 
        - Father: Perhaps the greatest achievement I'll ever accomplish without hoping to ever top it-- marrying the love of my life Savannah and raising my now 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter Leah. More a feat of luck and perserverance than of skill or smoothness. 

        Work experience highlights - 
        - Attached resume - containing all of my job experience with relevant contact information 
        - Alpha Ring US internship - one of the jobs I've had that I'm more proud of, I worked as a Lab intern at Alpha Ring US; a company that's working on miniaturized nuclear fusion reactors. 
        - Management Mo Bettahs - a demonstrable example of my leadership and team-based skills, I started as a dishwasher and advanced up to shift lead and off-premise coordinator. 

        Other skills - 
        - First aid - Safety, safety, safety. Understanding basic first aid and how to use it in tense situations is something I'm most proud of as a skill I've had to fall back on whether it be for myself or home environments or work environments before. 
        - Engineering minor / SolidWorks Associate - A former engineering major and current engineering minor, I have a basic understanding of principles of mechanical design, and achieved my Solidworks Associate certification. 
        - Python, HTML, CSS, SQL proficiencies - An ongoing skill I am learning and hope to improve upon throughout my college and professional career, I am at the very least basic/intermediate at my skills with these programming langauges, with plans to learn more about each langauge and other languages as well.
        - Technical problem-solving and robotics fabrication - I was a core fabricator throughout my highschool career for Monterey High School's robotics team, in which we competed in multiple state-level tournaments. 
        - Spanish fluency - The perks of living for 2 years as a full-time missionary in Argentina, though I'm told that my Argentine accent is strong-- I believe a friend of mine said specifically: "Talking to you in Spanish is like talking to a Scotsman in English"
        Why will people come to your site?
        To familiarize themselves with my web-design proficiency and other skills, and hopefully to find out more about who I am as a person and what my motivations are. 
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        'What skills does this candidate have?', 'Why should I hire him?', 'Why is his daughter so adorable in that pink dinosaur halloween costume?' (I can't help them there, that one baffles me too.) 
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        Contact me, Get to know me and a little about my family, Learn what kind of person I am, and why I would be a motivated, hardworking and competent addition both as an employee and potentially as a friend.   
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        Add a contact me section and probably a blog section. I'll also need pictures and personal anecdotes and maybe quips included. 
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        This site will hopefully serve multiple functions-- as personal portfolio yes, a demonstrable example of my budding CSS and HTML skills, and a glimpse into me as a person.

      <h3>Personal Blog</h3>
      <p>
        I'm bad at journaling, but maybe a Blog format will suit me better. I'm going to try my hand at it anyway.

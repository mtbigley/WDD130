        <h1>Personal Blog</h1>
        <p>A space where I try (emphasis on try) to journal more consistently. Expect stories, thoughts, lessons learned, and the occasional proud new dad moment.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the blog! I'm starting this as a way to reflect on life, family, my career path, and the things I'm learning. This website and especially this Blog will grow as I 
                        take more photos, have more thoughts and acquire more skills.

                    <h2>Trip to Oregon</h2>
                    <p>My family and I took a short trip up to Oregon — peaceful scenery, amazing gelato, and lots of fun memories. The water was freezing but that didn't stop us from hopping waves
                        and having a great time (especially little Leah; She's a really big fan of ice cream).

                    <h2>Donald Wright's 90th Birthday</h2>
                    <p>It's not every day someone in your family turns 90, so despite all the business of the season (holiday preparations, travel preparations and finals preparations can all combine to 
                        fill up one's dance card really quick), Savannah and I made a day-trip down to Utah to Celebrate. A good time was had by all, and it was great seeing my family-in-law; especially 
                        getting to meet a bunch of theretofore unfamiliar faces.

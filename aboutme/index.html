            Hey guys, I'm Michael. Some people call me 'Mikey B'. I'm late as heck on this assignment but eh 'it is what it is'. I'm married to the love of my life Savannah, and have 1 beautiful 2 year old daughter named Leah. 
            I'm from the central coast of California, and have been in rexburg since the pandemic.

            I'm a computer science major, formerly a mech. engineering major. I'm hoping to get into cybersecurity. I used to have a lot of hobbies, but a lot of things change when having kids-- most of my hobbies include more 2-year-old-friendly pastimes.

             I've been a member of the Church since I was a child, and served my mission in Mendoza, Argentina. Though my testimony has had it's ups and downs, I'm buoyed and anchored by experiences and individuals who support and love me.
